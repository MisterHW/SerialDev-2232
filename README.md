# SerialDev-2232
The SerialDev-2232 board is a 50 x 50 mmÂ² PCB that breaks out the two MPSSE ports, one as a JTAG / SPI / UART port, the other one as a fully featured MPSSE interface including the 8 bit parallel 245 type FIFO / bit banging interface for when you really need it.

Half of the PCB is dedicated to 5V, 3.3V, 1.2V supplies, 12 MHz clock source and a fully implemented FT2232H with EEPROM, all of which also feed into a linear header (cut the PCB in half for breadboard depolyment). The rest is just 0.1" perf board.
